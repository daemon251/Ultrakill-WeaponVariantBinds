This mod will probably conflict with other mods that add or remove weapons. 

# OVERVIEW

This mod aims to solve issues such as: fast shotgun swapping when a jackhammer is also in your cycle, and not being able to instantly select any specific weapon
(slot and variation). This mod can help reduce the number of clicks required to do some actions and prevent possible mistakes caused by confusion
when switching weapons. 

The mod does this by giving users the ability to create custom weapon cycles that can contain weapons in any order, in any amount (up to a hundred), and from any
weapon type.

This mod overrides vanilla weapon switching functionality, which lends itself to weapon mod conflicts.

# HOW IT CAN BE USED

The vanilla weapon cycles are included. In the advanced options in the weapon cycle, you may choose to ignore weapons in the cycle. To create a bind for the weapon you ignored, you will need to create a weapon cycle of length 1 for it.

Weapon cycles of length 1 can be used to create a bind for a specific weapon (slot and variation). 

Weapon cycles of length 2 will behave how you expect. I find these to be much more manageable than weapon cycles of length 3. 

Weapon cycles of high length can be used to plan out combos, which *might* be useful to speedrunners.
