# WARNING

This mod is in development. Expect issues. Raise an issue on the github project or contact me at discord preferably through the New Blood discord ultrakill-modding channel at: daemon8363

This mod may conflict with other mods that add or remove weapons. I have attempted to accomodate for these mods.

# OVERVIEW

Have you ever had the issue where you have two shotguns and one jackhammer on your shotgun weapon cycle, making fast shotgun swapping difficult? Have you ever wanted to make a specific bind for the marksman revolver? 

Well, you're in luck! That's the kind of problem that this mod aims to solve.

This mod features two configuration options that go hand-in-hand. The first, is specific weapon variation binds. This means that you can pull any weapon variation (ex. SRS rocket launcher) without having to cycle through your rocket launchers. 

The second feature is the ability to remove weapons from your weapon cycle, and make them only accessible via the previously mentioned specific weapon variation binds.  

Existing features to switch weapons will continue to work as they do in the vanilla game. This mod overrides no vanilla functionality.
